				<p id="sciencep">Merriam-Webster defines science as the knowledge about or study of the natural world based on facts learned through experiments and observation. In Innisdale STEM, students will explore the field of science through practical experiments that explore concepts outside of the school curriculum. Students will learn about the importance of the scientific method, and how it is applied within the classroom. Above all, students will gain an understanding of what the field of Science is all about, helping them make more informed decisions regarding their post-secondary pursuits.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp</p>

				<p id="techp">In today's technology-driven world, computers and other electronics are becoming increasingly powerful and versatile. To be well-versed in technological tools is a must for any individual, as the possibilities that technology offers us are boundless. In Innisdale STEM, students will explore the world of technology and how to effectively utilize technological tools in order to perform tasks and solve problems. This knowledge will be useful in any field, not just those related to technology, as the prevalence of computers and electronics in today's age means that they are used in virtually every sector, for tasks varying from computation to bookkeeping to modelling.</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p><b>Sample Activities:</b> Learning about statistical analysis(regression, Gaussian distributions), exploring the binary and hexadecimal number system

				<p id="engp">Engineering is the application of knowledge. It requires the use of mathematical, scientific, practical, as well as many other forms of knowledge in order to design structures, machines, and devices. Engineering is an extremely broad field that has many different forms, such as civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering. Engineers strive to improve the lives of individuals and society overall by solving problems through engineering design. Many of mankind's greatest achievements would not have been possible without engineers. Innisdale STEM provides students with an introduction to engineering design, and allows them to apply their knowledge in a practical setting. (S-K-U-L-E, Engineering U of T!)</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp</p>
				<p><b>Sample Activities:</b> Designing bridges with consideration to different types of forces (tension, compression, torsion), designing rubber-band catapults, egg drop challenge

				<div class="col-md-7">
				<p id="matp">Mathematics is often called the purest form of science. Without math, there would be virtually no basis for many of the fields of science we have today, such as physics, chemistry, and even biology. Computers and electronics rely on math. Engineering rely on math when designing or modelling things. To be familiar with and skilled at mathematical fundamentals is an essential skill for any individual looking to pursue a career in the STEM field. Innisdale STEM aims to provide students with a variety of useful mathematical concepts beyond the school curriculum, that will aid them in their post-secondary pursuits.</p>
